# T5 Text Summarizer

This repository contains an implementation of a text summarization model using Google's T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer). The model generates concise summaries from long-form text using state-of-the-art NLP techniques.

## Features
- Utilizes the pre-trained T5 model for text summarization.
- Supports both fine-tuned and general summarization models.
- Takes user input text and returns a concise summary.
- Easy-to-use interface with command-line or API integration.

## Installation
To use this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies. Ensure you have Python and necessary libraries installed.

## Usage
The model processes input text and generates a summarized output. It can be used via command-line or integrated into an API for broader applications.

## Example
A lengthy text can be input into the model, and it will return a condensed summary, preserving key information while reducing verbosity.

## Model
This project is based on the Hugging Face `T5ForConditionalGeneration` model, which is widely used for NLP tasks, including text summarization. Fine-tuning on specific datasets can enhance its performance.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- Transformers (Hugging Face)
- Flask (for API integration)
- Torch

## Future Improvements
- Enhance fine-tuning with domain-specific datasets.
- Implement a web UI for easier interaction.
- Optimize model for faster inference.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas or improvements, feel free to fork this repository and submit a pull request.
